 Tower Defense like game developed in Unity 2020.2.1f1

> This was a 3 day project to test my knowledge and capabilities in Unity, so the intent was to reach to level of development where the game is somewhat functional, and by just tweaking some numbers have a relatively fun game.

All the core functionality is already implemented, things like:
 - Buying, upgrading and selling turrets.
 - Different menus for different states of the game (start, pause and end).
 - Shop menu that automatically shows available items to buy based on current currency amount.
 - A wave system that controls how many and what type of enemies to spawn.
 - A save and load system of the game state (currently just for saving best scores).

Things that are missing are gameplay design such as:
 - Cost of turrets and their upgrades.
 - Different kind of turrets and enemies.
 - And whatever seems suitable to actually have a playable game (have in mind that in the state that I am presenting this project, it is already a playable game, it only needs to balance the currency and have more things just to be more fun).
 
And graphics desing:
 - This project didn't contemplate graphic desing. Nonetheless, things like the particle system is already set up, it only needs to be prettier.
 - It needs a complete design of the GUI (menus, buttons, texts, etc.).
 - Sounds and music.
 - Animations
